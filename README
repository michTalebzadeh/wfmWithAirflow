Setting up effective pipelines is essential to enterprises that have a hybrid model where they maintain data on Prem and in Cloud. Increasingly organizations are using Cloud for a variety of reasons. In this article, we will be talking through setting up pipelines to extract data from Oracle database upstream and load it into:
 Aerospike Enterprise Edition (EE) on Prem
 Aerospike EE running on dockers in Dataproc compute engines in Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
Google BigQuery table.
 Apache Airflow is used for creating data processing pipelines using Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). Using Airflow, the workflow is divided into tasks that are executed independently for each stream.
